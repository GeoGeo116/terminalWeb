# Terminal Website

## The aim
The aim for this website is to make a 'terminal' using **CSS** and **HTML**. While it won't function like an actual terminal, I am hoping to make some of the commands like **ls**, **cd** etc
At this stage, I am not familiar with JS, so I will be working on the design of the website, while learning JS.
This README file will be updated when the website works, and updated with commands, fixes etc
